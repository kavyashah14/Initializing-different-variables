# Initializing different variables

Variables are containers for storing data values, like numbers and characters.

In C, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123

float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99

char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
